  <h1>Chapter 4. Loomings.</h1>

  <p>
    But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there!
  </p>
  <p>
    Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. But here is an artist.

    Phobos est un corps très irrégulier, de dimensions 27 × 21,6 × 18,8 km, bien trop peu massif pour être en équilibre hydrostatique et donc pour avoir pris une forme quasi sphérique. Du fait de sa forme mais surtout de sa vitesse de rotation sur lui-même la gravité perceptible à sa surface varie d'environ 210 % suivant l'endroit où elle est mesurée7.

Phobos est un corps sombre qui semble être composé de chondrite carbonée8, une composition similaire à celle des astéroïdes de type C dans la ceinture d'astéroïdes externe9. Cependant, la masse volumique de Phobos est trop faible pour qu'il soit intégralement composé de roche et il possède une porosité significative10,11,12. Il a été suggéré que Phobos pourrait contenir un réservoir de glace substantiel, mais des observations spectrales de sa surface ont écarté cette hypothèse13.

La sonde soviétique Phobos 2 détecta que des gaz s'échappaient de Phobos en quantité faible mais régulière14. Malheureusement, la sonde tomba en panne avant d'avoir pu déterminer la nature de ce gaz.

En 1989, cette sonde Phobos 2 a été insérée sur une orbite de quasi-satellite par rapport à Phobos15.

Des images provenant de Mars Global Surveyor montrent que Phobos est recouvert d'une couche de régolithe d'au moins 100 m d'épaisseur ; on pense qu'il provient d'impacts avec d'autres corps, mais on ignore comment il peut adhérer à un objet ne possédant quasiment pas de gravité16; peut-être l'adhérence est-elle électrostatique17.

Au cours de l'été 2008, la sonde Mars Express a permis de préciser quelques caractéristiques de Phobos, dont la masse et la densité18.

    Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.

    But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?
